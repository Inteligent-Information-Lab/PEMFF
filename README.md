# PEMFF: Progressive Enhanced Multi-level Feature Fusion

This is the PyTorch implementation for our paper:
**Small Object Detection Network based on Progressive Enhanced Multi-level Feature Fusion**


## Environment Setup

### Requirements

This implementation uses the same environment configuration as YOLOv5. You can set up the environment using:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/PEMFF.git
cd PEMFF

# Create and activate a conda environment (optional)
conda create -n pemff python=3.8
conda activate pemff
```

### Dependencies

- Python ≥ 3.8
- PyTorch ≥ 1.7.0
- torchvision ≥ 0.8.1
- numpy
- opencv-python
- Pillow
- PyYAML
- tqdm
- tensorboard
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib


## Training

To train the model, use the `cmd.sh` script:

```bash
bash cmd.sh
```
